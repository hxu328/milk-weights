# milk-weights
Create an interactive data visualizer program with a graphic user interface (GUI) to help a local farm analyze and report on the milk that has been sold to them by their farmers. The data is in one file per month-year, so a year's worth of data is in 12 files that must be read into the program and used to display results and print reports.
